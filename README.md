# BOX - Raydium Yield Optimization Project

BOX is a [Raydium](https://raydium.io/) yield optimization project created during the [Hackathon 3.0 | Solana Taiwan 2022](https://hackathon.epochs.studio/). It aims to be a one-stop yield strategy platform and liquid market built on the [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com/).

## Raydium Challenge for Hackathon 3.0 | Solana Taiwan 2022

### Description

- A compounding function or bot that harvests and compounds farming rewards, or harvests RAY and stakes into single-sided staking

### Why this challenge?

- Manual compound is annoying
- Best yield LPs change frequently
- Staking reward isn‚Äôt attractive enough

## Introducing BOX - Liquidity Utilization for Solana

BOX is one-stop yield strategy platform and liquid market built on Solana.

The users stake their RAY tokens with BOX, which is using automatic staking strategies to delegate the RAY to [Raydium](https://raydium.io/) protocol, and the user receive "staked RAY" tokens called bRAY that they can use in the benefit of DeFi or to swap any time back to original RAY tokens to unstake.
